# Background

In this problem set we will use a small **sample** of data from the [General Social Survey](http://gss.norc.org/). The survey is designed to monitor changes in both social characteristics and attitudes. You will work with a **sample** from one neighborhood. The full neighborhood of **ALL individuals** is the population. For this problem set we do **not** know the **true population parameters** for any of the variables, because we do not have data on every person in the neighborhood. 

## Setup{-}

First load the necessary packages: 
 

```{r}
# Recall that loading the tidyverse "umbrella" package loads ggplot2, dplyr, and
# readr all at once. Feel free to load these packages any way you choose.
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
```

Next, load the data set from where it is stored on the web: 

```{r}
if(!dir.exists("./Data")){dir.create("./Data")}
url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSypSoDCMH2N76Vo2dZRPkw2q3t1mbvAXlOtgPDIsHg4NclAQFmER-BdvXH9_lrT40UQCVdPXOi_NMJ/pub?gid=257689625&single=true&output=csv"
if(!file.exists("./Data/gss_sample.csv")){ download.file(url, destfile = "./Data/gss_sample.csv")}
gss_sample <- read_csv("./Data/gss_sample.csv")
DT::datatable(gss_sample, rownames = FALSE)
```

Be sure to take a look at the data in Figure \@ref(fig:gssData). Each row in the data set is a person that was surveyed (100 rows or cases in total). The variables in the data set include each respondent's `age`,  `race`, and number of hours of TV watched a day `tvhours`. 

**Setting a seed:** We will take some random samples and build sampling distributions in this lab. In order to make sure R takes the same random sample every time you run your code, you can do what is called "setting a seed". Do this in any code chunk that you take a random sample! 

You can set a seed like so. Any number will do. (You do not need to run this right now...just showing you how)

```{r}
set.seed(45)
```

***

# Confidence Intervals from a Bootstrap Resample

## Step 1: Take 1000 Bootstrap Resamples{-}

The following code tells R to take 1000 bootstrap resamples from the `gss_sample` data. You can set the seed to whatever value you like! 

```{r}
set.seed(42)
boot_samp_1000 <- gss_sample %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = nrow(gss_sample), reps = 1000, replace = TRUE)
```

Note a few important details about the `rep_sample_n` function, and bootstrap sampling in general:

* `size = nrow(gss_sample)` tells R that each bootstrap resample we take has `r nrow(gss_sample)` cases... the size of the original sample.
* `reps = 1000` tells R to take 1000 bootstrap resamples (each of size 100).
* The `replace = TRUE` argument tells R that in each bootstrap resample, we can include a row from `gss_sample` multiple times. So if for instance, respondent # 12 is the first random resample taken here, respondent 12 is still available to be resampled **again** at random. Thus, some people may appear **multiple times** in our bootstrap resample, and some people from the original data set may not appear at all. 
* We save the results in a data frame `boot_samp_1000`. 
 

Take a look at the  `boot_samp_1000` data frame we just generated in Figure \@ref(fig:bootsamp1000). Note that the `replicate` column labels each bootstrap resample (the first 100 rows are labeled 1, the next 100 rows are labeled 2, etc.)

```{r, label = "bootsamp1000", fig.cap = "Bootstrap Distribution"}
DT::datatable((boot_samp_1000))
```

## Step 2: Calculate the Bootstrap Statistic{-}

Let's say we want to use the bootstrap resample that we just generated to calculate a confidence interval for the population mean $\mu_{tv}$ of `tvhours`. To do so, we need to know the sample mean $\bar{x}$ of `tvhours` **for each of the 1,000 bootstrap resamples**. In this case, the sample mean $\bar{x}$ of `tvhours` for **each bootstrap resample** is our **BOOTSTRAP STATISTIC**.  We can calculate that with three lines of code as follows: 

```{r}
boot_distrib_tv <- boot_samp_1000 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(stat = mean(tvhours))
# Viewing the data
head(boot_distrib_tv)
```

Note that:

- The `group_by()` argument tells R to take the sample mean of `tvhours` **separately** for each different `replicate` in the bootstrap resample. 
- We put the sample mean for each bootstrap resample in a column called `stat`


> This is the bootstrap distribution for the mean of `tvhours`! 

```{r}
# or using infer
library(infer)
boot_dist_tv_infer <- gss_sample %>% 
  specify(response = tvhours) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")
# using a for loop
B <- 1000
bs_mean <- numeric(B)
for(i in 1:B){
  bss <- sample(gss_sample$tvhours, size = sum(!is.na(gss_sample$tvhours)), replace = TRUE)
  bs_mean[i] <- mean(bss)
}
```

## Visualizing the Bootstrap Distribution{-}  

The bootstrap distribution is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:boottvdist) . This is a histogram of the `stat` values from `boot_distrib_tv`. 

```{r , label  = "boottvdist", fig.height=3, fig.width=5, fig.cap = "Bootstrap distribution of mean TV hours"}
ggplot(data = boot_distrib_tv, aes(x = stat)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 0.25) + 
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution", 
       x = "boostrap statistic (mean tvhours)")
```

```{r, label = "viz", fig.height=3, fig.width=5, fig.cap = "Bootstrap distribution computed with `visualize()`"}
# Or using the infer pipeline
visualize(boot_dist_tv_infer, bins = 9)
```

```{r, label = "basehist", fig.height=3, fig.width=5, fig.cap = "Bootstrap distribution of mean TV hours (base R histogram)"}
hist(bs_mean, breaks = "Scott", main = "Bootstrap Distribution",
     xlab = expression(paste(bar(x),"*")), col = "lightblue")
```


## Step 3: CI from a Bootstrap Resample {-}

### CI Using the 95% Rule {-}

We can now use the bootstrap distribution for the sample mean `tvhours` $\bar{x}$ to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean `tvhours` $\mu_{tv}$, using the "95% rule for bell shaped distributions", which states that the middle 95% of values of a bell/normal shaped distribution are between

$$\text{mean} \pm 1.96 \cdot SD$$

* the mean here is the mean of the original sample 
* the SD here is the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution, which recall has a special name: the **standard error**.

We can thus apply the 95% rule, like so: 

```{r}
# Note that z_{0.975} = 1.96 
qnorm(0.975)
(xbar <- mean(gss_sample$tvhours))
boot_dist_tv_infer %>% 
  summarize(se = sd(stat), 
            lower_ci = xbar - (qnorm(0.975) * se), 
            upper_ci = xbar + (qnorm(0.975) * se)) -> bnci_tv
bnci_tv
#
standard_error_ci <- boot_dist_tv_infer %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(type = "se", point_estimate = xbar, level = 0.95)
standard_error_ci
```



## CI Using the Percentile Method {-}

You can also calculate a 95% confidence interval using the percentile method. The logic goes like this: 

Since our bootstrap resample had 1000 values of `stat`:

* 950 of the `stat` values fall **inside** this 95% confidence interval, i.e. 95%
* 25 values fall **below** it. i.e. the lower 2.5%
* 25 values fall **above** it. i.e. the higher 2.5%

totaling 100%. We can use **the quantiles** of the bootstrap distribution to find these values as follows:

```{r}
bpci_tv <- boot_distrib_tv %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(stat, 0.025), 
            upper_ci = quantile(stat, 0.975))

bpci_tv
# Or using infer
boot_distrib_tv %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(type = "percentile", level = 0.95)
# Which is really just doing the following:
PCI <- boot_distrib_tv %>% 
            summarize(lower_ci = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper_ci = quantile(stat, 0.975))
PCI
```

This method 

* Asks R to identify the 0.025 quantile of the bootstrap sample means... this is the value **below** which **2.5% of the values of `stat`** fall (or 25 cases in this example... 25/1000 = 0.025)
* Asks R to identify the 0.975 quantile for the bootstrap sample means... this is the value **above** which the other **2.5% of the values of `stat`** fall (or 25 cases in this example  975/1000 = 0.975)
* The middle 95% of the values fall between these two quantiles

Based on these results, we are 95% confident that the **true mean hours of TV watched $\mu_{tv}$ in the population** is between the lower (`r PCI$lower_ci` hours) and upper (`r PCI$upper_ci` hours) CI endpoints we just calculated. 

## Visualizing the Confidence Interval {-}

The bootstrap distribution and the 95% **bootstrap percentile** confidence intervals we just calculated are shown in the figure below. This is a histogram of the `stat` values from `boot_distrib_tv`. The green line is the lower bound of the 95% CI, and the blue line is the upper bound. 950 of the 1000 bootstrap resamples had a mean for `tvhours` that fell **between** the green and blue dashed lines...25 of the samples had a mean above the blue dashed line, and 25 of the samples had a mean below the green dashed line. 

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
ggplot(data = boot_distrib_tv, aes(x = stat)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "pink", binwidth = 0.15) + 
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution with 95% CI", 
       x = "boostrap statistic (mean tvhours)") +
  geom_vline(data = bpci_tv, aes(xintercept = lower_ci), color = "green", lwd = 1, lty = "dashed") + 
  geom_vline(data = bpci_tv, aes(xintercept = upper_ci), color = "blue", lwd = 1, lty = "dashed") +
  theme_bw()
```


```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
boot_dist_tv_infer %>% visualize() +
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = PCI, color = "red", fill = "pink")

```

# Bootstrap Sampling Distribution & Confidence Intervals with Categorical Variables

The procedure for generating a bootstrap sampling distribution is VERY similar for categorical data. As an example we will generate a bootstrap sampling distribution for the proportion of respondents that identified as a Person of Color. 

## Step 1: Take 1000 Bootstrap Resamples{-}

We already did this above! We can use the same `boot_samp_1000` as before. 

## Step2:  Calculate the Bootstrap Statistic $\hat{p}${-}

```{r}
boot_distrib_POC <- boot_samp_1000 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            POC_count = sum(race == "POC"), 
            boot_stat = POC_count/n,
            phat_boot = mean(race == "POC"))
head(boot_distrib_POC)
```

Note that with a categorical variable, the code differs in two important respects now:  

* the population parameter that we don't know, but are inferring about via sampling, is now the population proportion $p$ that identify as a POC. 
* the sample statistic AKA point estimate that we calculate with the summarize command is now the **sample proportion** $\widehat{p}$ rather than a sample mean $\bar{x}$
* To get our proportion $\widehat{p}$ of **ONE** of the race categories (POC), we need to **first** calculate the total sample size for each replicate and the count of how many cases are `race == "POC"` in each replicate.

## Step 3: Generate the 95% Confidence Interval{-}

###  CI Using the 95% Rule {-}

The following will calculate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people that identified as `POC` using the 95% rule. 

```{r}
phat <- mean(gss_sample$race=="POC")
boot_distrib_POC %>% 
  summarize(se = sd(boot_stat), 
            lower_ci = phat - (qnorm(0.975) * se), 
            upper_ci = phat + (qnorm(0.975) * se))
```


###  CI with the Percentile Method {-}

The following will calculate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people that identified as "POC" using the percentile method. 

```{r}
boot_distrib_POC %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.025), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.975))
```

_____________

11. Calculate a 95% CI for the **population proportion** of respondents $p$ who identified as **White** using BOTH the percentile and the 95% rule method. Note that you will first need to generate the bootstrap distribution for the proportion of respondents who identified as `White`. 

```{r}
# Type your code and comments inside the code chunk

```

```{r}
# Type your code and comments inside the code chunk
# 95% rule

```

```{r}
# Type your code and comments inside the code chunk

# Confidence Intervals Based on the Theoretical Normal Distribution  

As described in [moderndive chapter 8.7.2](https://moderndive.netlify.app/8-confidence-intervals.html#theory-ci), not only can we generate confidence intervals using a computer/resampling as we've been doing until now, in many cases there also exists a mathematical formula! This however necessitates a little mathematical/probability theory; a topic we leave to a more advanced statistics class.

To generate a $(1 - \alpha)\cdot 100$% confidence interval based on the theoretical normal distribution, we can use the following formula: 

$$\widehat{\text{point estimate}} \pm z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \cdot \widehat{SE}$$

So, for instance if we wanted to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean of `tvhours` $\mu_{tv}$ that respondents watched based on our sample: 

* the **point estimate** AKA **sample statistic** in this case would be the sample mean number of `tvhours` from the sample: $\bar{x}$
* We would estimate the standard error using the formula: where $s$ is the **sample standard deviation**, which is a point estimate of the **population standard deviation** $\sigma$:

$$\widehat{SE} \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

and thus a 95% CI $\rightarrow \alpha = 0.05 \rightarrow z_{1 - \frac{0.05}{2}} \rightarrow z_{0.975} = `r qnorm(0.975)`$ would be

$$
\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \cdot \widehat{SE} =  \bar{x} \pm 1.96 \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

We can perform the calculations in R as follows: 

```{r}
x_bar = mean(gss_sample$tvhours)
gss_sample %>% 
  summarize(sd = sd(tvhours), 
            n = n(), 
            se = sd/sqrt(n), 
            lower_ci = x_bar - qnorm(.975) * se, 
            upper_ci = x_bar + qnorm(.975) * se) -> tci_tv
tci_tv
```

___________


12. Write down the three 95% confidence intervals for the population mean of `tvhours` $\mu_{tv}$ you've computed in this problem set. Do this by replacing
X, Y, A, B, P, and Q with the appropriate values you've computed. 

When you are done, make sure all the `|` in the table still line up so your results print out in a table! 


CI construction method          | lower value   | upper value
------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------  
Using boostrap: 95% rule        | X             | Y
Using boostrap: percentile rule | A             | B
Using mathematical formula      | P             | Q

______________

13.  **In your opinion**: would you say these three confidence intervals are similar?
